## CfP for SwiftFest Boston 2019

SwiftFest Boston 2019 will take place April 8th-9th, 2019, at the Calderwood Pavillion for the Arts inn Boston, MA.
Grab your ticket and submit a talk at [swiftfest.io](https://swiftfest.io).

### What kind of talks are we looking for?

Talks at SwiftFest Boston 2019 come in 3 different flavors: a keynote, a 25min talk and a 50min talk. SwiftFest Boston will have two parallel tracks:

* The "Swift Soul" which will focus on technical talks about Swift.
* The "Swift Overloaded" which will have a broader range of topics, such as: mobile development processes, design, cross-platform development for Swift, etc.

Before you submit your talk, have a look at the slides from previous SwiftFest Boston events to get a feeling for what kind of talks were given in the past.

### Resources for your talk?

We plan to provide dedicated speaker support over time,like e.g. resources on how to give a good talk, resources on how to create a good abstract, etc.. We plan to add more resources over time as well as provide a dedicated feedback channel should your submission be accepted.

Some good resources for submitting and giving a talk are:

* [7 best practices for giving a conference talk](https://opensource.com/article/17/9/7-best-practices-giving-conference-talk)
*[Speak your science: How to give a better conference talk](http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2018/0206-speak-your-science.html)
